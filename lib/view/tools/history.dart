The History panel displays the sequence of Photoshop states as you progress through a Photoshop session. To select a previous state, just click to select the desired history state to make it active.
One can look at the History as a multiple undo feature in which you can reverse through up to 1000 image states, but in actual fact History is a far more sophisticated and powerful tool than just that. Painting from History, using the history brush, saves you from tedious workarounds like having to duplicate a portion of the image to another layer, retouching this layer and merging back down to the underlying layer again. History states can also be temporarily saved as Snapshots as you work.

You can then paint information in from a previous history state (or from one of the snapshots) to the active state. The history brush therefore lets you selectively restore the previously held image information as desired. That is a simple way of looking at the history brush, but it has the potential to be very versatile.
The number of recorded histories can be set in the Photoshop preferences. When the maximum number of history states has been reached, the earliest history state at the top of the list is discarded. If you reduce the number of history states allowed, any subsequent action will also cause the earlier history states beyond this number to be discarded.
The History feature does not really take on the role of a repeat Edit Undo command and nor should it. There are a number of Photoshop procedures which will remain undoable only by using the Edit Undo command, like intermediate changes when setting the shadows and highlights in the Levels dialog.
