The first two tools allow you to specify your own selections, either with hand drawn or straight edges. The Magnetic Lasso tool introduces some more advanced features that allow you to make selections that follow edges, with Photoshop doing most of the heavy lifting for you. Please read on and I'll introduce you to the different Lasso tools and show you how to use them in your own work.

The Polygonal Lasso tool requires you to click at different points, which are then joined by a straight selection. You can close the selection by double-clicking or moving the cursor back to the start point and clicking. We'll look at the Magnetic Lasso later.
